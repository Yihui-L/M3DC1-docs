    Plots the field of a file
    
    Arguments:

    **field**
    The field that is to be plotted, i.e. 'magnetic field'

    **filename**
    File name which will be read, i.e. "../C1.h5"
    Can also be a list of two filepaths when used for diff

    **time**
    The time-slice which will be used for the field plot

    **linear**
    Plot the linear part of the field (so the equilibrium is subtracted).
    True/False
    
    **diff**
    Plot the difference of two fields. 
    This could be the difference of two files (filename=['a/C1.h5','b/C1.h5']),
    or the difference between two time-slices (time=[t1,t2])
    If list for both time and filename are given file1 will be evaluated at time1,
    and file2 at time2

    **R_res**
    Number of points sampled in R direction

    **phi_res**
    Number of points sampled in phi direction

    **Z_res**
    Number of points sampled in Z direction
